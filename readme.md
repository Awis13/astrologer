# Astrologer

This is a program that uses the OpenAI API to generate text acting as an astrologer and providing in-depth readings for clients based on their birth chart. It prompts the user to input their place of birth, date of birth, and time of birth, and then passes this information as a prompt to the API. The API returns a response object, which contains a list of possible completions for the prompt, and the program prints the text of the first choice in this list.

## Installation

To use this program, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- `openai`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`: pip install openai


## Usage

To use the program, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it in the code. Then, you can run the program using Python: python astrologer.py


The program will prompt you to enter your place of birth, date of birth, and time of birth. Once you have entered this information, it will pass it as a prompt to the OpenAI API and print the generated text to the console.

## Customization

You can customize the generated text by modifying the prompt and the parameters passed to the OpenAI API. For example, you can adjust the temperature parameter to control the level of creativity in the generated text, or you can change the max_tokens parameter to specify the maximum number of tokens (words) in the generated text.
